Notes:,"Current version is v1.7.

v1.0 - The Kickstarter Edition. Successfully funded on Kickstarter January 30, 2011, raising $15,570 with 758 backers. Officially released May 13, 2011. First sold on the Cards Against Humanity Store website on June 14, 2011, and then available on Amazon.com on June 15, 2011.
Canadian Edition Base Set - Started out as a Canadian Conversion Kit that was included when someone from Canada ordered the CAH Main Deck (US Version). It was apparently released some time in late 2011 to early 2012. The Canadian Conversion Kit is no longer available and has been superceded by a CAH Canadian Edition, v1.6 (unable to find the release date of the Canadian Edition). Only available to customers in Canada. Icon: A maple leaf.
UK Edition Base Set - Released on September 24,2013. Only available to customers in the UK. Icon: A bulldog.
Australian Base Set - Released on October 31, 2014. Only available to customers in Australia. Icon: An emu.
Cards Against Humanity for Her - Released July 11, 2017. It is the US Base Set v1.7 in pink packaging being sold for $5 more than the US Base Set with all profits being donated to Emily's List, and therefore does not warrant a separate listing of cards."

Dear Canadian,
Thanks for buying or stealing this copy of Cards Against Humanity!
Some of the cards in our game were written for fat, stupid Americans. To ensure that your game is as funny as possible we've gone to the bare minimum of effort to write a few replacement cards.
On the next card, you'll find a list of cards that you might want to replace. Once you've customized your game to your liking, feel free to burn these instructions for warmth.
